			Welcome to my page.

		<div class="paragraph">
			I made this page to house projects and tutorials, as well as provide
			a little bit of info about myself. It is still under construction!

			I am currently working on two projects, one of which is on github. The first is an easy to use,
			approachable 3D printer control shield for the Arduino Uno based off
			RAMPS 1.3. The second is a control based system for my capstone project. The 3D printer shield (called RAUPS) is still
			being worked on, and it is continually being updated.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
			I also upload various small tutorials and programming challenge
			problems that I have taken part in. The tutorials are being updated
			and improved upon constantly. Some are used as a very, very fast
			introduction to a programming language. Others deal with various
			topics that interest me, that I wanted to share and teach to other
			people.
