                                            that would brush up syntax in preparation for programming challenges. As I learn about more features and
                                            implementing different libraries, they will be updated.

                                            introductory level. The Arduino tutorials were used at workshops I ran very successfully, with audiences
                                            ranging from no knowledge of circuits to first year engineering students. The PCB workshop was also
                                            created to aid in a workshop.
