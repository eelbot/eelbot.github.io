            <div class="collapse_content">Pico Commander is a a capstone project. It is a controller that offers a simple
                                            PC interface from which to control and monitor circuits. It is completely open source (under GPL v3). It features USB
                                            to PC communication, ability to control and monitor 8 inputs and 8 outputs, as well as SPI broken
                                            out to allow for future expansion.

            <div class="collapse_content">At first I created booster packs as a testing platform for the PicoCommander project, but they are quickly
                                            progressing to become projects all their own.

                                        The <strong>BufferLP</strong> Booster Pack provides 8 inputs and 8 outputs working at 5V, capable of sinking 180mA each.
                                        It provides extra power, and allows the launchpad to be easily powered externally via a 5V DC Jack. It follows the standard
                                        LaunchPad layout, and has almost no extra code overhead. Besides controlling the 5V inputs and outputs, a small amount of extra
                                        code needs to be added to enable/disable the buffers. The hardware files are provided, with Energia and CCS examples coming in
                                        the near future.

                                        The <strong>USBLP</strong> Booster Pack breaks out the built in USB pins on the TMS320F28069M Booster Pack, and also connects
                                        an SPI flash chip to SPIB. This booster pack is not universally compatible, since not every LaunchPad has built in USB pins. A CCS
                                        example will be uploaded in the near future, since Energia does not break out the USB functionality built into the LaunchPad.
