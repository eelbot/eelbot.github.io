            <div class="collapse_content">Controller Card is a a capstone project. It is a PC to circuit interface, similar to solutions offered
                                            from companies like National Instruments. It is completely open source. It features USB
                                            to PC communication, ability to control and monitor 8 inputs and 8 outputs, as well as SPI broken
                                            out to allow for future expansion. It is currently in very early development.

            <div class="collapse_content">RAUPS is a fork and redesign of the hardware associated with RAMPS, a 3D printer controler shield.
                                            It stands for RepRap Arduino Uno Pololu Shield, and is currently in the testing and debugging stages
                                            of development. This is an attempt to make the RepRap firmware available on a smaller, cheaper
                                            controller than the Due or Mega. This project is almost out of the development stage and in the
                                            support stage.
